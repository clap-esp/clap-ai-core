1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:02,128
 So

2
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:03,375
 you

3
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,407
 Day one.

4
00:00:02,688 --> 00:00:03,688
 We made it!

5
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,179
 Thank you.

6
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,320
 Fucking rain!

7
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:06,823
 Poor England.

8
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,184
 It was pretty bad. Everything is so good.

9
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:09,971
 Yeah.

10
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,199
 No, it's soaking wet.

11
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:13,231
 you

12
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:13,455
 you

13
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:12,743
 Ah!

14
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,896
 you

15
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:13,715
 happen.

16
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,599
 you

17
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:14,823
 Thank you.

18
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,984
 you

19
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,580
 Thank you.

20
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:14,868
 Thank you.

21
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:17,024
 Shoes are totally wet.

22
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:18,976
 Socks totally wet.

23
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:20,071
 If we bring them dry.

24
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:22,335
 It was a torrential downpour, no chance.

25
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,559
 you

26
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,579
 So next time Gore-Tech's pants, not just Gore-Tech's jacket.

27
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,579
 No.

28
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,140
 and Gators.

29
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:30,928
 because well, I think my socks got wet.

30
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,640
 from actually going through my pan.

31
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,704
 you

32
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,024
 you

33
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:34,944
 I don't know Gator's right. Maybe.

34
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:35,636
 Thank you.

35
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:37,615
 you

36
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:37,695
 Oh, and that it was pretty beautiful.

37
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:39,527
 but you can't take any pictures or videos

38
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:41,408
 because it's a torrential downpour.

39
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,375
 you

40
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,207
 And none of the camera stuff.

41
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:45,295
 is

42
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:44,115
 water from.

43
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,543
 you

44
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,687
 Um, yeah.

45
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,679
 It was.

46
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:49,807
 you

47
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:49,164
 easier than I expected.

48
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
 So it was a bit of a...

49
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:51,984
 Stroll.

50
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,095
 you

51
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:54,384
 you

52
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:54,768
 you

53
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,927
 at some points a little bit steep.

54
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:54,824
 but that was about it.

55
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:57,008
 you

56
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,272
 And yeah.

57
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,439
 It's a 5-2 onsite.

58
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,219
 Zhang.

59
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,136
 you

60
00:00:59,423 --> 00:00:59,923
 Thank you.

61
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,148
 Thank you.

62
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:02,543
 you

63
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:01,235
 Thank you.

64
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
 you

65
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,399
 And then that, yeah, we're cold.

66
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:05,712
 you

67
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:07,408
 We just arrived. This is our tent and we're going to wait for dinner.

68
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:07,956
 and stuff.

69
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,816
 Speaking of which, somebody's coming in.

70
00:01:10,944 --> 00:01:12,944
 you

71
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,519
 you

72
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:12,403
 Daddy boo!

73
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:13,075
 Thank you.

74
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:14,927
 you

75
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,664
 you
