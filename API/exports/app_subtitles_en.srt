00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,330
Hello everyone

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,779
Well

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,000
I am in the

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the tail means that I have never coded a line

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the code since my

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you love me therefore I am rather than products therefore

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I am a product consultant at Zenika and

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,730
well after

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,000
over and over again from Jul here I am

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
[ Noise ]

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,750
no and so

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to talk to you about product management, to whom the product speaks

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,570
Well

16
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,000
I did well to

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
[ Noise ]

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
really the goal to really give you a presentation

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Product management summary 10 minutes

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will of course teach you everything and

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,090
say show that

22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:01,450
Well

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,000
the developers also have a recreate

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in this product management approach

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
what is product management product management is an approach to creation and innovation

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
put me centered and directed on the product there you will tell me

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
what is the product Eva the product

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bitch it can be a service or a good that meets a need

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
specific to one or more users

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,799
so actually

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,000
all you develop in itself is products

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,400
so what

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
really consists

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,439
Well

35
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,109
This is what we find

36
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:40,000
In fact

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
put in the center really 3

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,140
you love me what are business marketing knowledge

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,709
In fact

40
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,000
Well

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
we have a product the objective is to sell how we are going to sell it to whom we are addressing

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to which market

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
turnover we plan to make how we are going to sell the

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,250
country with what pricing or

45
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,250
others so in fact

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,000
there is all this thinking there

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
there is the design part how we do it we will

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
pose an experience to users so that

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
how he still wants to use it back

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
bring back user retention

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and to the

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,669
Haiti part

53
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:22,000
Well

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is really the realization

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
delivery comment on what is - what are we going to use

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to be able to set it up is available

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
of the target customer

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
really it's a bit of a whole

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,449
and so in fact

60
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:41,819
And

61
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:42,180
L

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,909
' together

63
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:43,270
Well

64
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,000
they are

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're going to tell me that on the developer side it's very

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,569
but precisely

67
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,000
I think there is an interest in that

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
person working on a product understands at least

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the C3 large areas and it touches a little

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in a way therefore

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the concept of product management is a sentence

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that I use a lot and that I often put I say that it is often the most important sentence

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
come when I do training for management it is

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the concept will be validated by proof as quickly as possible

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
your work on the right product so

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,599
what does it mean validated by proof

77
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,000
In fact

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It is that we

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,710
good I had directors who said

80
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,290
Well here it is

81
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,000
we will do this functionality

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,229
it's gonna be awesome

83
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:33,849
in general

84
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,000
it's not really proof

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,250
SO

86
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,750
it's good it's more of an opinion

87
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,500
and in fact

88
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,000
it's necessary

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
validate this opinion if you need to

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,180
East

91
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,000
- what there will really be of having the value of the impact for the

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,229
radiator upstream and

93
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,849
In fact

94
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:52,000
validate by proof it can be

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
before development but also after development

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you are awesome you have developed what is - which proves that after this feature

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I will develop and really great what you are basing it on

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,330
as soon as possible

99
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,670
Well

100
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,000
it's simply the fact

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,360
Well

102
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,000
if we have ideas and we want to be able to

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
at what time are the most users? Well if we are the first

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,329
more likely to acquire them and

105
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,000
also well

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
that some us

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,569
change quickly

108
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,430
and also well

109
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,000
it allows the faster we do it, the more we validate

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
quickly the test and that we work on the right product and there you go

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
yesterday what is the good product and well it's a bit really

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you are of some use to the three axes that we saw previously

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's really about making sure that we're responding to the need for a real problem.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,459
why it is important because

115
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,079
In fact

116
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,000
if we solve

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
problem well there will be none easily no use

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,620
the fact

119
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:48,920
that

120
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,230
Well

121
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,000
there is room on the market here

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
there may be competition, the competition which also already responds very well

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
if we want to deliver a product almost

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,290
versatile

125
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,000
we try there is little chance that it will succeed the fact

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
for the company the objective of the company is

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's about making money, so here are the investments that will

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,620
well

129
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,000
you there will be a return on investment and also

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the super important point that it is technically feasible

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
so there

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
- above

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
what is the approach a little bit of

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
overall protection Seba for

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
make sure of the previous sentence

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
every time it is better to start on a product to have a vision

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,250
drink

138
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,500
we want to go in the direction of Cape Town, it's

139
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,000
In fact

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
to bring on board the people who work on the product

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,569
SO

142
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:52,000
television is not particularly

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
very very clear and that's a bit why we

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,329
but

145
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:00,000
after that it is how we will reach this vision therefore

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
put the strategy

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
actually there

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
10 is really all we are going to put in place for

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
turn off the vision so understand the market

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,269
how to master your sound product the functional is -

151
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:15,639
This

152
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,000
that

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
come knowingly the ex

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,560
what do we offer and also collect the different feedback and

155
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:23,780
All

156
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:24,000
For

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
listen rotate if necessary for different features

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,329
Who

159
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:32,000
results from it

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,470
In fact

161
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,590
This is the remark what is also

162
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:34,819
Well

163
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,000
the camp will deliver it

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,139
and also

165
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,000
a governance aspect but here it is

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It is all the stakeholders who will be able to interact to make

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
advance the product I will go now

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
a little more in detail for example on the vision

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
often something you can touch

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
job often it often makes the difference

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's just having a vision and not a plan

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There is this example of Martin Luther King for civil rights.

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
bathrobe in the United States he didn't say we're going soon

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
no actually

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
he really has

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
you are right that all these people can demonstrate

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and have a real weight which has allowed them to access the order

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This famous I have a dream speech which really allowed

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to take on a large number of people

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
be black himself - black and who wished

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
give me equality of people so really that will be the why

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the reason for being a little of the product it can be something

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's very short but really specific and not transposable, that means

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
escape it only belongs to this product it can not use for another product

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,399
And

186
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,000
This really helps to explain the why

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
small aside I don't know if you know this face

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Simone Sinex's spear on

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,709
please why it is important

190
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:06,289
In fact

191
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,000
to bring some why for

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,910
people who work in the company

193
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,270
Well

194
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:12,000
simply

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
easier to move forward with them

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I will move forward because I only have left

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
10 minutes on vision

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,399
we have the vision and then

199
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:26,799
Well

200
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
it will be

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
destroy this product and well we will go through big ones

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
one of which you know well and one perhaps a little less well which is the Discovery

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
how what are we going to do

204
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,309
This

205
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:44,000
product what are we going to deliver and

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
how do we make sure that we will be able to do it?

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to give impact and that the product is a product

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is the stage of Discovery and we will define

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
responds to user issues with solutions that will

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so being the delivery will be how we will deliver our solutions

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
if developers intervene but on Discovery developers can also

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
better understand customer expectations and intervene

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
how to also do inter participate in user interviews to see

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
how the product is used

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
it m '

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,669
in

217
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,000
come now

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,139
parenthesis so in fact

219
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:28,000
Product management is really a holistic approach

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
with different aspects which are business design

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
steak for me I define it more it is not a work framework

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,710
It's more of a set of practices that we can use

223
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,000
For

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
of the success of our product a

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
really this approach allows to lead the whole thing early

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
investment therefore the fact of validating the hypotheses before development

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,440
so this

228
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,000
This is the Discovery stage that I just told you about to reduce precisely

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the vision that allows to give

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,669
direction and

231
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:01,000
A

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
also sense the products and embark the whole

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and the people involved in the product too

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It is also important to focus on the impact of functions

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
functionality delivered and not just on functionality and

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It is very important to validate the impact

237
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Valerie after it is delivered and the last one

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,539
No, it's just that

239
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:26,149
In fact

240
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,000
Developers have a crucial role

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,450
creation of these products

242
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,640
actually going actually

243
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,000
to touch

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,330
for example in

245
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,000
Discovery participant ensure

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
product forecast - are we still consistent with this vision or not?

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
so there are a lot of things that can be seen on

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
product management and I think the Daves have a role there too

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,289
And

250
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:52,000
that will be all it's 10 minutes it's very short

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,529
and here it is

252
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,199
This is a small introduction but with pleasure for

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,470
in

254
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,000
talk after

255
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,059
